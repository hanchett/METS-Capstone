# DiscoverEd

This repository contains the code for DiscoverEd, a capstone project for the Informatics program at the University of Washington. 


## Introduction:

Special education programs in the US are on the rise, with 30% growth over the last decade, and becoming an umbrella program, encompassing both disabilities related programs and supplementary education programs. Educators who work with high needs student populations have turned to technology like mobile and desktop application that allow them to enhance their studentâ€™s experience, helping their students learn and achieve at the highest possible level.

Although the technologies exist, teachers struggle to find technologies that address the needs of their students investing time scouring the Internet. DiscoverEd is a web application that connects you directly to inclusive technology that fits the needs of your student populations.


## Features

### Personalization:
Upon account creation, DiscoverEd redirects users to a survey to gain a better understanding of their classroom environments and provides a recommended set of technologies for the users to investigate further.

### Product Search:
DiscoverEd allows users to explore a centralized repository of inclusive educational applications and software, updated by our team and by users.

### Product Reviews:
Each product has a review page that allows users to help other users on their selection decisions, and how they can be used to helps your students thrive. We also integrated questions from our survey within the review process to strengthen our recommendations.

### Collaborative Forums:
During our research, we found that many teachers struggle collaborating with their peers within their own schools due to office politics and drama. WE created a forum for these teachers to collaborate semi-anonymously (only their usernames are shown) so that they can receive advice and input from other educations working in special education.


## Technology

### How to Run:

To run our application, please clone the repository on your local machine and open the bash command line application on your machine. Once in bash, change into the application directory and run this line of code: `npm run start-dev` and the application should be up and running on localhost:3001.

If you encounter any issues running the application, please create an issue on this repository and we can attempt to resolve it.

### Stack:
Our team chose to use the MERN stack (MongoDB and Node.js backend, Express middleware, and React frontend). We chose this stack because our developers had worked with it in previous projects.

### Database Management:
We chose to use MongoDB due to our team's familiarity with the free tier availability through mLab.


## Project Deployment:

Our project is not currently deployed on a live platform, so here is a link to a Google Slides presentation with gifs of the application in action:
