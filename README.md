This repository contains the code for our Informatics Capstone project. This website is designed for STEM teachers to use to help build their curriculums around educational technologies with a student-first focus. We allow teachers to search by the needs of their students, such as visual learners, non-native English speakers and more. Additonally, we're creating a community to enable collaboration between teachers, especially as they wrok through bringing their curriculums up to Next Generation Science Standards.
